					<h3>Kyle Espinola</h3>
					<h4 class="semi-bold">Product & Co-Founder</h4>
					<p>I am a recent graduate of UCSB. I started practicing yoga 5 years ago in order to better my balance and strength for surfing. Today the benefits of yoga for me go far beyond surfing. My yoga practice helps me find clarity and resilience. OMZA is my chance to give back to yoga.</p> 
					<p>I believe yoga is essential for your personal wellness. I hope you'll find your yoga class using OMZA.</p>

					<p>I've been teaching yoga across the US for the last 3 years. A year ago I moved to Santa Barbara. </p>
					<p> I am so excited to be starting this venture in beautiful Santa Barbara community. I truly believe OMZA will help so many new yogis find a class that will connect deeper to their practice.</p>
					<p>I am manifesting OMZA to be a way for students to connect to their practice, their teachers and their Self.</p>
